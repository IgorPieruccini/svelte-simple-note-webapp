# Svelte simple note web application

This simple note application is developed with SvelteKit
and it's part of a learning experiment of the framework. 
    
The motivation is primary to learn the framework with a real project example
and how much of knowledge is transported from other web framework to svelte

npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
